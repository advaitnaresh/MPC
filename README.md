# MPC 

This is a Readme file for the Project under Professor Amit Setia. 
The title for the project is Model Predictive Control in Robotics.

By using Model Predictive Control one can accurately predict the next most optimised step to take in order to reach your destination faster. 
This is done by predicting from a large number of predictions based on our control horizon and choosing the first most optimised prediction and following the same
for the other predictions. 

This concept is currently being used in chemical plants , with a large number of applications in autonomous vehicals , obstacle avoidance etc.
